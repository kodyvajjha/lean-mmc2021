# Welcome to Formal Proofs at MMC-2021!

This repository will house the code and slides for the Formal Proofs lectures at Monsoon Math Camp 2021. 

## Getting Started

You will need to install Lean+VS Code/Emacs for the best experience. The links below have OS-specific installation instructions and video walkthroughs. 

* [Windows.](https://leanprover-community.github.io/install/windows.html)
* [MacOS.](https://leanprover-community.github.io/install/macos.html)
* [Debian/Ubuntu.](https://leanprover-community.github.io/install/debian.html)
* [Other Linux.](https://leanprover-community.github.io/install/linux.html)

If you don't want to try any of these, then Lean does [work in a browser](https://leanprover-community.github.io/lean-web-editor/), but it may be slow and is not recommended for serious use.

After you install Lean and it's supporting tooling using the above links, open a terminal and type `leanproject get kodyvajjha/lean-mmc2021` to clone this repository into your local computer. Next, open up the repository in either VS Code using the command `code lean-mmc2021`. You should now be ready to start proving!

## Outline

This course will be more interactive than the other courses and you will have plenty of practice problems to work on at your own pace. 

## Help

### Tactic help

* [Tactic cheatsheet:](https://leanprover-community.github.io//img/lean-tactics.pdf) A list of most-used tactics.
* [Matlib tactics:](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/tactics.html) More advanced tactics.

### Get me a human!

* Your instructors will keep checking Discord in the `#formal-proof-general` channel, through the week to offer help if you need it. 
* You are also encouraged to ask questions on the official [Lean Zulip Chat](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com). The Lean community is very beginner-friendly.

## Further Reading

Here's a partial list of references you can follow:

* [Theorem Proving in Lean (TPiL):](https://leanprover.github.io/theorem_proving_in_lean/) Canonical reference for Lean. Great for introducing the basics of dependent type theory and how to work in it using Lean. 
* [Mathematics in Lean:](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathematics_in_lean/) Companion volume to TPiL, and has a greater emphasis on tactics and doing mathematics in Lean.
* [The Hitchhikerâ€™s Guide to Logical Verification:](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blanchette/logical_verification_2020/master/hitchhikers_guide.pdf) Slightly more advanced presentation, with a view towards CS applications.
